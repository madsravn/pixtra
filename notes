Make sure that the examples also runs on the CI. Not only their tests.


Something about adding, subtracting pixels should result in a pixelbuilder
Same for multiplying and dividing constants. Can you do something like (5.0f * Pixel).build() ?

Create a binary with clap. What should we be able to do? 

Look up eframe and egui to see if you can utilize that to create an actual program using this lib. Should be its own project maybe? 

FIX BLENDING OF COLORS: https://www.reddit.com/r/GraphicsProgramming/comments/z54jge/what_is_the_formula_for_drawing_rgba_on_rgba/
"If it's not fully white (255), it gets blended with the thing behind it."
Should you have different blend modes? Just start with one.
Look at https://www.andersriggelsen.dk/glblendfunc.php for more functions and modes


Figure out how to best make documentation

Make documentation


Implement KMeans clustering for finding dominant colors. Counting colors. Colors with more than X occurrences. Orphan pixels. Coordinates for certain colors. 
This could be good in a front end.

resize	Image sampling Resize the supplied image to the specified dimensions. nwidth and nheight are the new dimensions. filter is the sampling filter to use.
rotate90	Affine transformations Rotate an image 90 degrees clockwise.
rotate90_in	Affine transformations Rotate an image 90 degrees clockwise and put the result into the destination ImageBuffer.
rotate180	Affine transformations Rotate an image 180 degrees clockwise.
